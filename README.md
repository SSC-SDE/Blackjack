# Blackjack
A classic game of Blackjack using Python and Tkinter.
So that you can review my code while enjoying a good hand in Blackjack(Good Luck :)
The SVG playing cards used are taken from: http://svg-cards.sourceforge.net/
SVG-cards is a set of decks of playing cards made using a XML-based language called SVG. The cards are made of geometric elements rather than a grid of pixels.
Being based on XML, SVG-cards works on all platform, from smartphones to all desktop computers, video games consoles, etc... This is a fully portable design. And, of course, it is perfect for embedding on web pages.
